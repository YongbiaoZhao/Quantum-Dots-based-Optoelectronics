# Quantum-Dots-based-Optoelectronics
This place is to serve as my base for sharing my knowledge about quantum dot technologies, most on optoelectronic research and applications. I will try to cover main fields, such as lgith-emitting diodes(LEDs), solar cells and photodetectors. The contents will focus on more about current development and giving some useful guidelines for experiement design and pratices.

Please let me know if you find anything wrong inside, I will try my best to accomode all your suggestions.

Thanks and enjoy learning!
